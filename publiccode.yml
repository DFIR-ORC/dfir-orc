    longDescription: |
      DFIR ORC, where ORC stands for “Outil de Recherche de Compromission” in
      French, is a collection of specialized tools dedicated to reliably parse
      and collect critical artefacts such as the MFT, registry hives or event
      logs. It can also embed external tools and their configurations.


      DFIR ORC collects data, but does not analyze it: it is not meant to triage
      machines. It cannot spy on an attacker either, as an EDR or HIDS/HIPS
      would. It rather provides a forensically relevant snapshot of machines
      running Microsoft Windows.


      Along the years, it has evolved to become stable and reliable software to
      faithfully collect unaltered data. Meant to scale up for use on large
      installed bases, it supports fine-tuning to have low impact on production
      environments.


      DFIR-ORC incorporates the entire tool collection within a single
      executable. The tools can be executed manually or configured for automated
      deployment with ToolEmbed, allowing for background execution to conserve
      CPU and I/O resources, as well as encryption of the results and their
      transmission, along with many other features.
